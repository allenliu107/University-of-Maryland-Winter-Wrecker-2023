# University-of-Maryland-Winter-Wrecker-2023
#This project scrapes data from openpowerlifting.com to create a table of meet results from the University of Maryland Powerlifters.

#The file "Scrapping for Winter Wrecker Meet" takes all the data from the meet and formats it into a CSV.
#The Advanced Topic Web scraping Criteria Items 10.1-10.3 are all met in that file

#The file "Pandas" takes the CSV file Winter Wrecker with the meet results and only returns the data from UMD lifters
#The Advance Topic Pandas Items 8.1-8.4 are all met in that file
